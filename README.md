# arduinotoys

Hacking with arduino is fun. Even when the hacker is one such as myself that
hasn't coded in a long time.

As I play with things, I may put them here.

Do not expect things of grandure. Expect things to break - think of it as 
darwinian evolution for code.

As to structure - 
  /libs is where I put classes or libraries that I've written
  /projects is where I'll put my projects as I work on them.
 
Feel free to browse and perhaps giggle. If you do the latter, make sure
to leave some advice on how to improve.

These are toys. Feel free to play with them, but don't cry if they explode on you.
